useful tools and debugging

in production mode the entire code is minified compressed in whaterver means in order to
increase the performance of the code for the users end.


In short the dev mode is for the Developers advantage i.e it helps the Developers have a good
experiance with the code and the production mode is for the users to have a good experiance with the
ui.
