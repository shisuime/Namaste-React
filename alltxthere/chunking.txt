chunking
code splitting
dynamic bundling
lazy loading 
on demand loading
dynamic import 

these are concepts which we need while builing large scale projects because if the bundler just makes one index.js file out of hundreds of components then it 
will severely effect the performance of the website.

is bundling good or bad?

bundling is good to an extent but if the scale is too large then you have to go for logical bundling where all these concepts come into play.


while lazy loading it takes some time to load the bundle so in the mean time react tries to render the file which results in a suspension of the  
rendering so it throws an error everytime.

so we need one more react component called suspense which takes care of all the things.

suspense takes a prop called fallback which shows you what you need to show in the mean time when the bundle loads.
