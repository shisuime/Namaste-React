Keys help React identify which items have changed, are added, or are removed.
we need it to give a unique id to every element so that react can easy work out with the positioning 
,removing or adding with the addition of positioning.

yes we can use index as keys in react but it is not recommended as it can negatively impact performance and may 
cause issues with component state.
